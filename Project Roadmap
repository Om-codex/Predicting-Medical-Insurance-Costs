Project Idea: Predicting Medical Insurance Costs ðŸ©º


The Goal: To build a linear regression model that predicts a person's annual medical charges based on their personal information (age, sex, BMI, smoking status, etc.).

Your Project Roadmap
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan. This roadmap is exactly what employers look for in a portfolio project.

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning (EDA)
This is where you'll use your Pandas and NumPy skills.
	â€¢ Load the dataset and inspect it (.head(), .info(), .describe()).
	â€¢ Check for missing values and decide how to handle them (though this dataset is quite clean).
	â€¢ Use your descriptive statistics knowledge to understand the distributions of age, BMI, and charges. Are they normally distributed? If not, why?

2. Visualization & Statistical Insights
Flex your Matplotlib, Seaborn, and stats muscles.
	â€¢ Ask questions and answer them with plots:
		â—‹ How do medical charges differ between smokers and non-smokers? A box plot would be perfect here.
		â—‹ Is there a relationship between age and charges? A scatter plot will reveal this.
		â—‹ How is BMI distributed? A histogram or KDE plot is ideal.
	â€¢ Apply Hypothesis Testing: Run a t-test to statistically determine if the difference in charges between smokers and non-smokers is significant. This is a fantastic way to show you can apply statistical theory.
	â€¢ Create a correlation heatmap to see which numerical features are most related to the charges.

3. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
This is a critical step before modeling.
	â€¢ The model needs numbers, not text. You'll need to convert categorical columns (sex, smoker, region) into numerical ones.
	â€¢ The standard method for this is One-Hot Encoding. You can use Pandas' pd.get_dummies() function for this. This is a new, simple, and essential skill you'll learn.

4. Model Building
Time to apply your new ML knowledge.
	â€¢ Separate your data into features (X) and the target variable (y, the charges column).
	â€¢ Import LinearRegression from scikit-learn.
	â€¢ Train your model on the data using the .fit() method.

5. Model Evaluation
A model is useless if you don't know how well it performs.
	â€¢ Use your trained model to make predictions on your data.
	â€¢ Measure your model's performance using standard regression metrics like:
		â—‹ R-squared (RÂ²): The percentage of the variance in the charges that your model can explain.
		â—‹ Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between your model's predictions and the actual charges.
	â€¢ You'll learn how to import and use these metrics from scikit-learn.

6. Conclusion & Storytelling
Summarize your findings in a clear, concise way.
	â€¢ What were the most important factors in predicting medical costs? (Hint: Look at the model's coefficients).
	â€¢ How well did your model perform? Was it accurate?
	â€¢ What were the key insights from your EDA?
